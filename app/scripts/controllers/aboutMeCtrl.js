	, "At 15, I remember discovering my chosen profession: information technology! My parents had an old 486 and I spent hours trying to find something to do with that contraption, even without the help of internet."
	, "Before working with IT, I've always been a fan of technology, video games, computers and smart devices."
	, 'When the time came to choose a college course I did not have many problems and I chose to make Information Systems at UFSC. In college I came only with my "knowledge" as User and I had a lot of difficulty in the first half to understand how it all worked. One topic that caught my attention was the "Software Development". The idea of some lines of code turning into something that could help people fascinated me from the start.'
	, "As my course was evening, I had the privilege of working since the first month of college, starting as support and finally as a programmer in 2010. Since then I've worked exclusively with software development with different types of companies and working with various types of professionals."
	, "After a few years working exclusively with the Java language focusing to the backend, I began to study frameworks and languages by myself ​​that could give me greater autonomy during the development cycle. I started studying and developing some projects using Adobe Flex and in the last two years I started to study more deeply Java Script language and the main frameworks for development in that language."
	, "Looking into the future, I intent to use all the knowledge acquired during the years to become a Solutions Architect and help businesses figure out which technologies may be more fitting to the problems they are proposed to solve."
